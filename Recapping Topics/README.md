### Recapping List of Topics:

---

1. **MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture**

In this section, we'll dive into the MVC design pattern, a cornerstone of web development. You'll learn how MVC breaks down an application into three parts: Model, View, and Controller. This separation helps keep your code organized and manageable, especially as your projects grow. We'll look at examples like Express.js in NodeJS to see MVC in action and discuss why this pattern is so popular for building scalable applications.

---

2. **HTTP/HTTPS with NodeJS**

Here, we'll explore the basics of HTTP and HTTPS, the protocols that power the web. You'll learn how to set up a simple HTTP server using NodeJS, which is a great way to understand how web requests and responses work. We'll also cover the importance of HTTPS for securing data and how to implement it in your NodeJS applications. By the end of this section, you'll have hands-on experience building a basic server.

---

3. **Rest API vs GraphQL**

This part of the course will help you understand the differences between REST and GraphQL, two popular ways to build APIs. We'll discuss their core principles, how they handle data, and when you might choose one over the other. You'll get to set up both REST and GraphQL endpoints, giving you practical insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

---

4. **SQL vs NoSQL Databases**

We'll explore the world of databases by comparing SQL and NoSQL. You'll learn about their different data models and when to use each type. We'll look at examples like MySQL and MongoDB, and you'll get to practice basic CRUD operations. This hands-on experience will help you understand how to manage and store data effectively.

---

5. **Dependency Injection**

In this section, we'll cover dependency injection, a key concept in software design that helps make your code more modular and testable. You'll learn how to implement dependency injection in NodeJS and why it's a best practice for building maintainable applications. We'll go through examples to show how this technique can simplify your code structure.

---

6. **Docker and Ports**

We'll introduce you to Docker, a tool that makes it easy to run applications in containers. You'll learn about the role of ports in networking and how they help containers communicate. We'll guide you through setting up a Docker environment and running a simple NodeJS application in a container. This practical experience is essential for understanding modern deployment strategies.

---

7. **Pros and Cons of Microservices**

Here, we'll explore microservices architecture, which breaks applications into smaller, independent services. You'll learn about the benefits, like scalability and flexibility, as well as the challenges, such as increased complexity. We'll look at real-world examples to see how microservices are used in practice and discuss whether this approach might be right for your projects.

---

8. **Pros and Cons of Serverless Computing**

Finally, we'll delve into serverless computing, where the cloud provider manages the server infrastructure for you. You'll learn about the advantages, like cost savings and automatic scaling, and the potential downsides, such as cold starts. We'll discuss scenarios where serverless architecture shines, helping you decide if it's a good fit for your applications.
